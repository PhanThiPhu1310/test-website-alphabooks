# Test Website Alphabooks
This project serves as a comprehensive guide to automated testing methodologies, utilizing industry-standard tools like NUnit, Selenium WebDriver, and Postman. Through practical examples and step-by-step instructions,  design and execute effective test cases for various aspects of web applications, including:
## Unit Testing:
  Validate core functionalities, such as mathematical calculations, using NUnit and data-driven techniques.
## Web Application Testing:
  Automate testing of crucial user interactions, such as registration, login, password recovery, and password change, on the Alphabooks Bookstore website using Selenium WebDriver.
## API Testing: 
  Interact with  API using Postman, executing requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and verifying responses against expected outcomes.
### Chapter 1: NUnit (C#) Data-Driven Unit Testing
  - Environment Setup: Create a Windows Forms project in Visual Studio 2019, design the interface, and implement the necessary classes.
  - Unit Testing: Develop test cases to validate functions calculating the circumference and area of a circle.
  - Data-Driven Testing: Utilize input data stored in a .csv file to automate tests with multiple data sets.
  - Results: Display outcomes of test cases for various input scenarios.
### Chapter 2: WebDriver (C#) - Testing the Alphabooks Bookstore Website
  - User Registration Testing:
      Successful registrations and failure cases (e.g., missing information, invalid email formats, incorrect phone numbers).
  - User Login Testing:
      Successful logins and failure scenarios (e.g., incorrect credentials, incomplete fields).
  - Password Recovery Testing:
      Validating both successful recoveries and errors due to invalid or missing email inputs.
  - Password Change Testing:
      Successful changes and error cases such as incorrect current passwords, mismatched new passwords, and insufficient password length.
  - Each feature includes meticulously designed test cases and execution results.
### Chapter 3: API Testing with Postman
  - Json Server Setup: Configure the environment to create a mock API from the 52_Phu_57_Qui.json file.
  - API Requests Execution: Perform operations like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE on the mock server.
  - Automated Testing: Write test scripts to validate both successful and failing API calls.
This project aims to provide a solid foundation in automated testing principles and equip with the practical skills necessary to enhance the quality and reliability of web applications.
